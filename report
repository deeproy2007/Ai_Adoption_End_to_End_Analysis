# AI Adoption in Colleges – Data Analytics Project

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the impact of **AI adoption in colleges** on student performance, engagement, and attendance. Using **SQL analysis**, **Power BI dashboards**, and multiple datasets, the project evaluates whether AI-driven platforms improve academic outcomes.

---

## Objectives

* Analyze colleges that adopted AI platforms
* Measure GPA changes before and after AI adoption
* Study student engagement with EdTech platforms
* Identify departments and semesters benefiting most from AI
* Create an interactive Power BI dashboard for insights

---

## Datasets Used

The project uses four datasets:

1. **colleges.csv**

   * college_id
   * college_name
   * adoption_year
   * ai_platform

2. **students.csv**

   * student_id
   * student_name
   * department
   * college_id

3. **performance.csv**

   * student_id
   * gpa_before_ai
   * gpa_after_ai
   * attendance_before_ai
   * attendance_after_ai
   * semester

4. **edtech_usage.csv**

   * student_id
   * hours_spent
   * quizzes_taken
   * ai_recommendations_accepted

---

## Tools & Technologies

* SQL (MySQL)
* Power BI
* CSV datasets
* GitHub

---

## Methodology

1. Imported datasets into MySQL database (`collegedb1`)
2. Performed analytical SQL queries for insights
3. Validated results using joins and aggregations
4. Built Power BI dashboard for visualization
5. Interpreted trends and summarized findings

---

## SQL Analysis

The SQL file includes queries to:

* Identify colleges adopting AI in 2024
* Count students per department
* Compare GPA before and after AI adoption
* Find top students based on EdTech usage
* Analyze correlation between AI usage and GPA improvement
* Measure attendance improvement
* Identify best-performing AI platforms
* Compare first-year vs final-year student improvements

(SQL queries are available in `college_analysis_sql.sql`)

---

## Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides:

* GPA trends before vs after AI adoption
* Student engagement analysis (hours spent on EdTech)
* Department-wise performance comparison
* AI platform effectiveness

Dashboard File:

* `college_dashboard.pbix`

---

## Key Insights

* Colleges adopting AI showed measurable GPA improvement
* Students spending more time on EdTech platforms generally improved performance
* Certain departments benefited more from AI integration
* Final-year students showed different improvement patterns compared to first-year students

---

## Conclusion

AI adoption in colleges positively impacts academic performance, attendance, and engagement. Data-driven insights support strategic investment in AI-based education platforms.

---

## Future Scope

* Add larger real-world datasets
* Include predictive modeling
* Compare multiple academic years
* Integrate student feedback analysis
